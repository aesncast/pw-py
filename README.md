# pw-py - password generator

Password generator inspired by [ss64](https://ss64.com/pass/).

This command-line tool deterministically generates passwords.
You can provide a domain, a user and a key and the tool will always give the same password for the same domain, user and key combination.

## Usage

- Basic Usage

```
$ pw-py <domain> <user>
Encryption key: <key>
(password is now copied to clipboard for 5 seconds)
```

- Example

```
$ pw-py github.com aesncast
Encryption key: mykey
("Slide Paso ho=op Dizzy" is now copied to clipboard for 5 seconds)
```

The clipboard is cleared after 5 seconds.

Domains and users are recorded in `<pw-py local data directory>/pwlist4` and can be listed (for e.g. shell completion) with `pw-py -l [domain]` (leave domain empty to list domains).

## Special Dependencies
Some systems might need non-Python libraries or executables for pw-py to work correctly.

### Linux

`xsel` might be needed for copy/paste to work.

## Building standalone executable
Skip this step if only an installation is needed.
Python3 `pyinstaller` is required to build a standalone executable.
Execute the following command to build a standalone executable in `dist/`:

    $ make

## Installing
Python `setuptools` are required to properly resolve dependencies and install pw-py.
Execute the following command to install pw-py libraries and console script (`sudo` may be required on Linux):

    $ python3 ./setup.py install
   
or

    $ pip install .
    
## Sequences

pw-py offers the use of transformation sequences to transform the input triple (key, domain, user) into a password.
Upon the first start of pw-py, if no pwfile4 exists on the system, an empty pwlist4 with a sequence called `good_password` will be generated in `<pw-py local data directory>/pwlist4` and looks something like this:

```
[+good_password]
    init($key, $domain, $user)
    diceware(4, 4)
    capitalize_some()
    add_some_simple_special_characters()
```

Each line represents one transformation step:
- `init` concatenates the input triple into a single string
- `diceware` deterministically generates 4 words from the diceware wordlist using the output of `init` as seed
- `capitalize_some` capitalizes at least one, at most all words in the output of `diceware`, with the output of `diceware` as seed
- `add_some_simple_special_characters` adds some special characters to the output of `capitalize_some`
- the output of `add_some_simple_special_characters` is then the resulting password that is copied to the clipboard.

The built-in sequence `LEGACY1` is compatible with the passwords generated by the [ss64 password generator](https://ss64.com/pass/) (parameter "user" will be ignored).
    
## Q&A

### How?
pw-py takes your input (domain, user for that domain, secret key) and deterministically transforms the input into what is hopefully a good password.

### Deterministic?
For the same input and transformation sequence, pw-py will always yield the same password.

### Why?
To generate good passwords.

### 'Good' passwords?
- decently long
- lower-case letters, upper-case letters, symbols, numbers
- easy to remember

### Why not use [ss64 password generator](https://ss64.com/pass/)?
While [ss64 password generator](https://ss64.com/pass/) generates long, strong passwords, the generated passwords are complex (i.e. good luck remembering them), therefore causing you to depend on the password generator to have access to anything that uses the generated passwords.
pw-py generates passwords that are (by default) easier to remember by generating a phrase which uses words from the [diceware](https://theworld.com/%7Ereinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc) wordlist (and includes spaces as well for legibility).
And pw-py has a built-in compatibility sequence to generate the same passwords that the [ss64 password generator](https://ss64.com/pass/) generates.

### So is this a password manager?
No, pw-py only remembers domains, users and sequences.
No keys or passwords will be remembered, do that yourself.
